# Your Store
A simple program for installing software in Linux Mint. 

Preface: The basic idea is to make Linux / Debian as simple as Windows or Mac OS instead of developing a new operating system. 

An important part of this endeavor is to simplify and make copy-compatible programs that are used by thousands of people every day. Especially the easy installation of non-Linux programs is an important part.

# Installer for Version 0.2 is live!
A first installer for version 0.2 of the Y-Store. If there are any bugs please report them, then they can be removed. It must be ensured that pip and Pyhton work! The program is then located in /BumbleBee which is created. I will improve it as it is not perfect yet.
