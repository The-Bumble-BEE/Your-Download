A simple program for installing software in Linux Mint. 

Preface: The basic idea is to make Linux / Debian as simple as Windows or Mac OS instead of developing a new operating system. 

An important part of this endeavor is to simplify and make copy-compatible programs that are used by thousands of people every day. Especially the easy installation of non-Linux programs is an important part.
